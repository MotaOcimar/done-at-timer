# Product Guidelines

## 1. Visual Identity & Design Principles

- **Aesthetic:** **Minimalist but Playful (Gamified Focus).**
  - **Core Philosophy:** The design must be clean and uncluttered to promote focus, avoiding distractions. However, it should not be sterile. It should feel "gamified" through the use of vibrant, interesting colors and engaging UI elements that invite interaction.
  - **Elements:** Use distinct, "chunky" or tactile-looking buttons and progress bars that feel satisfying to interact with. Think of high-quality productivity games or habit trackers.
  - **Color Palette:**
    - **Primary:** A strong, motivating color for the "Action" button (Start/Play).
    - **Secondary:** Distinct colors for different task states (e.g., active, completed, pending) to provide immediate visual feedback.
    - **Background:** Clean, neutral background to let the colorful elements pop.
  - **Typography:** Clear, large, and legible fonts for the "Arrival Time" display. It should be readable at a glance.

## 2. User Experience (UX)

- **Focus-First:** The primary view when a timer is running should be the current task and the _predicted completion time_.
- **Frictionless Interaction:** Starting, stopping, and switching tasks should be instantaneous and require minimal clicks.
- **Gamified Feedback:**
  - **Completion:** Visual and/or auditory rewards for finishing a task (e.g., a satisfying checkmark animation, a pleasant sound).
  - **Progress:** A clear visual representation of progress through the _entire list_, not just the current task (e.g., a progress bar filling up as the "Arrival Time" draws nearer).
- **Flexible Flow:** The UI must support the "out of order" execution model. Users should be able to tap any task in the list to start it without navigating through complex menus.

## 3. Tone of Voice

- **Persona:** **The Supportive Coach.**
- **Tone:** Encouraging, positive, and helpful. It should frame time management as a tool for freedom, not a source of stress.
- **Copy Examples:**
  - _Instead of:_ "You are late." -> _Try:_ "Let's adjust! New arrival time: 14:45."
  - _Instead of:_ "Task expired." -> _Try:_ "Done with [Task]? Great job! Next up..."
  - _Instead of:_ "Start." -> _Try:_ "Let's Go!" or "Focus."

## 4. Accessibility

- **High Contrast:** Ensure text and key elements are easily readable against their backgrounds.
- **Clear Visual Cues:** Use more than just color to indicate status (e.g., icons + color) to support users with color vision deficiencies.
