# ⏱️ Done-At Timer

**Know exactly when you'll be done. Stop racing against the clock and start arriving on time.**

Most timers tell you how much time is *left*. **Done-At Timer** tells you when you will *arrive*. 

Whether it's your morning routine, a focused work session, or getting ready for a night out, we often suffer from **Time Blindness**—the inability to sense how long a sequence of tasks will actually take. We see "20 minutes for a shower" and "15 minutes for breakfast" as abstract numbers, failing to realize that if we start *now*, we won't be out the door until 8:35 AM.

**Done-At Timer is your GPS for daily life.** It calculates your "ETA" (Estimated Time of Arrival) for your entire list of tasks in real-time.
